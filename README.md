Open Source Wedding Invitation
==================

FAQ

## Can I use this to invite myself to the wedding

No.

## Can I convert this to [insert language here]

I think having the same template done in different languages would be pretty cool. If you want a .php invite, start an invitation.php and make it pretty!
